Reminder of command syntax:

git log (q to exit, arrow keys to scroll)
git cat-file -p <hash>
log is a porcelain command, while cat-file is a plumbing command. You'll use log much more often when working on coding projects, but cat-file is useful for us in this course to understand Git's internals.

Assignment
Create a second file called titles.md and add the following text:
# Titles

- A River Runs Through It
- Fight Club
- 12 Years a Slave
- The Big Short
- 12 Monkeys

Save, stage, and commit the file with any commit message you like as long as it starts with B:.
For example, B: add titles.
Use (git cat-file) to inspect the commit you just made. You should notice one extra field in the commit object that wasn't present in the first commit.
Run and submit the CLI tests from the root of your repo.
